    In a given grid, each cell can have one of three values:

    the value 0 representing an empty cell;
    the value 1 representing a fresh orange;
    the value 2 representing a rotten orange.

    Every minute, any fresh orange that is adjacent (4-directionally) to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

    Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange.  If this is impossible, return -1 instead.
